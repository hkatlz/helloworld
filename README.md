When you create a branch, you’re making a copy of the original branch as it was at that point in time (like a photo snapshot). If the original branch changes while you’re working on your new branch, no worries, you can always pull in those updates.    

To create a new branch

    Go to your new repository hello-world.
    Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
    Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
    Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.
